# Mixed Signal Analyser — STM32F401RE

Bare-metal firmware for a mixed signal analyser running on the STM32F401RE (Nucleo-64).
Written in Rust using the Embassy async executor — no heap, no OS, no RTOS abstraction layer.

## What it does

| Subsystem | Hardware | Detail |
|---|---|---|
| Analogue capture | PA0, PA1 → ADC1 | DMA ring buffer (4096 samples), interleaved 2-channel, converted to mV |
| PWM generation | PA8–PA11 → TIM1 | 4 channels at 10 kHz: 25 / 50 / 75 / 10 % duty cycles |
| PWM input capture | PA6 → TIM3 | Measures period ticks, pulse width, duty cycle % |
| Boot health checks | RCC, SRAM | Clock tree verification, stack canary (0xDEAD_BEEF), RAM pattern test |

Analogue and digital modes are selected at compile time via feature flags — no branching at runtime.

## Technical highlights

- **DMA ring buffer** — ADC samples land in a static `[u16; 4096]` without CPU intervention; Embassy's `into_ring_buffered` drives continuous dual-channel acquisition
- **Two independent timers** — TIM1 as SimplePwm (output), TIM3 as PwmInput (input capture), wired via `bind_interrupts!`
- **Boot integrity** — before spawning any task, the firmware verifies the clock tree, writes/reads a stack canary, and pattern-tests 16 words of SRAM using `write_volatile`/`read_volatile`
- **MPU** — 4 hardware memory protection regions configured before init: flash read-only, SRAM no-execute, peripheral space device memory, stack overflow guard at 0x2000_4000
- **Custom bootloader** — separate binary at 0x0800_0000; validates application SP and reset vector before writing VTOR and branching via `msr msp` / `bx`
- **Async on Cortex-M4** — Embassy's cooperative scheduler; tasks yield at `.await` points, no preemption needed
- **Zero heap** — no `alloc`, no dynamic dispatch; all buffers are static

## Flash layout

```
0x0800_0000  bootloader  (32 KB — sectors 0–1)
0x0800_8000  firmware    (480 KB — sectors 2–7)
0x2000_0000  SRAM        (96 KB)
0x2000_4000    └── stack overflow guard (256 B, MPU region 3 → MemFault)
0x2001_8000    └── stack top
```

## Build & flash

```bash
# 1. Flash bootloader
cd bootloader && cargo build --release
probe-rs download --chip STM32F401RETx \
    ../target/thumbv7em-none-eabihf/release/bootloader

# 2. Flash firmware (analogue mode)
cd ../firmware && cargo build --release
probe-rs download --chip STM32F401RETx \
    ../target/thumbv7em-none-eabihf/release/firmware

# 3. Attach RTT and run
probe-rs run --chip STM32F401RETx \
    ../target/thumbv7em-none-eabihf/release/firmware

# Digital mode
cargo build --release --no-default-features --features digital
```

Requires [probe-rs](https://probe.rs) and an ST-Link on the Nucleo board.

## Hardware

**Board:** NUCLEO-F401RE  
**MCU:** STM32F401RE — Cortex-M4 @ 84 MHz (configured via PLL: HSI → /8 → ×168 → /4)

```
PA0  — ADC1 CH0  (analogue in)
PA1  — ADC1 CH1  (analogue in)
PA6  — TIM3 CH1  (PWM capture in)
PA8  — TIM1 CH1  (PWM out 25%)
PA9  — TIM1 CH2  (PWM out 50%)
PA10 — TIM1 CH3  (PWM out 75%)
PA11 — TIM1 CH4  (PWM out 10%)
```

## Roadmap

- [ ] Bootloader: CRC-32 verification of firmware image before jump (currently validates SP + reset vector only)
- [ ] MPU: MemFault handler with defmt stack dump — catch overflows with context, not just a hang
- [ ] MPU: per-task stack regions — enforce isolation between Embassy async tasks
